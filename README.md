# shoes2match
This application is a virtual closet for your shoes. The idea is to always have access to what you own so you can ensure you have the perfect shoes to match your outfit.

## Technologies
This application is a MERN Stack.  The frontend is built using React and React router.  The backend is build with MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, and Express.  The axios dependency is used to make the calls to databse. It is a full CRUD application.

## User Stories
* The user opens the application to a landing page with a quick explanation of what the app is.
* The user can view the shoes.
* The user can add new shoes.
* The user can edit shoes.
* The user can delete shoes.

## Improvement Opportunities
The user is redirected to the homepage after edit and addition.  This could be altered if the State was moved up into the main App.
Rewrite or convert this to a mobile application, and give the user the ability to just take the picture of their shoes instead of typing in a URL.

## Unresolved Problems
Had some difficulties with styling the <Link> elements.  Also could not figure out why the buttons and links behavior was odd (especially in the responsive settings.)

## Links to Live Sites
Both the frontend and the database have repositories on GitHub and are deployed to Heroku.
